        <td>
          A consumer individual that, within a single lifecycle stage, feeds on more than one resource individual but does not kill that resource individual (host). Damage to the resource individual is intensity-dependent; the more micropredators feeding on a resource individual the greater the resource's loss of fitness. Examples: mosquitoes, leafhoppers, most butterfly fishes. Micropredators can be important vectors for pathogens.

          Parasitic Castration

        <td>
          A consumer individual blocks the reproduction of the resource individual (host). Thus, while they reduce host fitness to zero, parasitic castrators do not necessarily reduce survivorship of the stolen host body. The effect on the host is intensity-independent in that there is no additive reproductive effect of additional parasitic castrators on the host. Examples: digenean trematode parthenitae, bopyrid isopods, rhizocephalan barnacles, most strepsipterans.

        <td>
          A consumer individual infects a single resource individual (host) and then multiplies within that host. Death of the host will ensue unless its defensive mechanisms or external forces (Examples: other consumers) limit the infection. The effects are intensity-independent, as the outcome may result from a single infectious agent (or inoculum). These consumers are appropriately modeled using microparasite models (Anderson and May, 1979). Examples: smallpox, diphtheria, malaria, lice, scale insects, <font>Gyrodactylus</font> <font>monogenean flatworms.</font>

          A consumer individual infects an individual host, does not necessarily cause the death of its host and does not reduce the fitness of the host to zero. Also it is not trophically transmissible to other hosts. Impact on the host is intensity-dependent, These consumers are appropriately modeled using macroparasite models (May and Anderson, 1979). Examples: adult cestodes, Ichthyopthirius ciliates, corn borers, whip worms, fleas, most parasitic copepods.

        <td>
          A consumer individual kills only a single resource (host) individual. Its impact on the host is intensity-independent. Examples: parasitoid wasp larvae, bacteriophages, insect iridoviruses, pasteurella viruses, nematomorphs. If the host is an adult, reproduction ceases before host death.

          An infectious consumer individual blocks a host’s reproduction and requires that its host be consumed by an appropriate predator host for lifecycle completion. Trophically transmitted parasitic castrators often manipulate the host phenotype to increase trophic transmission to the predator host. Examples: <font>Schistocephalus</font> <font>tapeworm pleroceroid larvae, some microphallid trematodes in molluscan hosts.</font>

          An infectious consumer individual multiplies within a resource individual (host) and requires that the host be consumed by an appropriate predator host in order to complete its lifecycle.

          An infectious consumer on a resource (host), where the consumer requires its host to be consumed by an appropriate predator host to complete its life cycle.

          Trophic Transmission
        </td>
        <td>
          A consumer individual consumes a free-living infectious agent or trophically transmitted infectious agent that is able to infect it, thus furthering the infectious agent's life cycle. This describes the link between the appropriate predator or micropredator host and the parasite. This is opposed to the "trophically transmitted" categories, which describe the interaction between a parasite and its resource host that will be consumed by a predator during trophic transmission. Trophic transmission is similar to Concurrent Predation on Symbionts in that it describes ingestion of a parasite by a consumer, but differs in that this ingestion can lead to transmission of the parasite from the prey to the predator. Likewise, it is similar to Predation on Free-living Non-feeding stages, but differs in that consumption of the free-living stage can lead to transmission of the parasite. It some analyses, it may be well worthwhile to separate out the three types of "trophic transmission" lumped here: (1) the typical trophic transmission to a predator (e.g., a bird becoming infected by trematode metacercaria encysted in fish prey), (2) trophic transmission to a micropredator (e.g., mosquitos becoming infected by malaria gametocytes when feeding on bird blood), and (3) a predator becoming infected when eating a free-living infectious stage (e.g., a fish becoming infected when it ingests a swimming <font>Renicola buchanani</font> <font>trematode cercaria).</font>

        <td>
          The outcome of a feeding interaction of a micropredator depends on the relative size of the prey or host individual. On a large host the consumer is a micropredator, but on a small prey the consumer is a predator. The relative sizes determining feeding outcomes are system specific.(Examples: vampire bats, lampreys, fang blennies). Related terms used in system and taxon specific contexts include browser, grazer and sublethal predator.

Not all of a species' lifecycle stages are necessarily present a particular food web.

          Facultative Micropredator
        </td>
        <td>
          The outcome of a feeding interaction of a facultative micropredator depends on the relative size of the prey or host individual. On a large host the consumer is a micropredator, but on a small prey the consumer is a predator. The relative sizes determining feeding outcomes are system specific (Examples: vampire bats, lampreys, fang blennies). Related terms used in system and taxon-specific contexts include browser, grazer and sublethal predator.

          Mean body weight reflects the local population size structure. Weights were obtained from individuals encountered during stratified random sampling in that estuary (Kuris et al. 2008). The estimate was usually based on length measurements, often including width and height. We obtained individual weight by either using weight-length curves (obtained for that species or for related or similarly shaped animals), or by using estimated body volume and assuming tissue density of 1.1 g/mL. Because parasitic castrators grow in close proportion to host growth, we applied parasite to host weight ratios to the population mass-frequency distribution of infected hosts (we directly measured weight ratios for many species and gave average species estimates to other species).

As an example for free-living species, the abundance of the larvae of a species of bivalve was estimated by apportioning the quantified estimates of total bivalve larval abundance by the quantified relative abundance of adults or juveniles of that species.

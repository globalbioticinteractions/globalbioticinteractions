        </td>
        <td>
          The unordered nominal definition of a trophic interaction corresponding to the LinkTypeID column. Link types are mutually exclusive. We use the term ‘symbiont’ after De Bary (1879), to refer to all mutuals, commensals and parasites for which a larger organism serves as the single individual with which the symbiont interacts for the duration of its life or lifestage. We use 'host’ to refer to the resource individual in all symbiotic interactions and, by convention, for micropredation. We use ‘prey’ to designate resource individuals when the consumer is not a symbiont or a micropredator. Not all links are trophic (Example: commensal) and care must be taken to exclude these from some analyses of food web structure.

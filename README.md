Welcome to the Global Biotic Interactions (GloBI) project.
======================================

This mission of this project is to find efficient ways to normalize and integrate species interaction data to enable researchers and enthusiasts to answer questions like: Which species does an Angel Shark ( _Squatina squatina_ ) eat in the Gulf of Mexico?
Please see http://github.com/jhpoelen/eol-globi-data/wiki for more information.
